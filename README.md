## ⚠️ Evergreen Disclaimer

Microsoft cloud services — including Microsoft Entra, Graph API, and Azure — are **evergreen** platforms. This means features, APIs, and behaviours can change frequently.

> **Scripts and examples in this repository were tested at the time of writing.**  
> However, they may require updates in the future to reflect changes in Microsoft’s platform or API behavior.

If you encounter issues or see something that needs updating, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
